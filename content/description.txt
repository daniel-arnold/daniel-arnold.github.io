Welcome to my personal website.  I am a research scientist with a background in control systems, optimization, and machine learning, who is passionate about applied research.  In addition to studying and applying algorithms from these fields to solve practical real-world problems, I greatly enjoy teaching both fundamental and advanced concepts in these areas.  On this site, you'll find some details of my CV, as well as links to some independent projects.

Prior to earning my PhD at Cal, I developed nonlinear and adaptive control algorithms for unmanned underwater vehicles for the U.S. Navy.  During my PhD studies, I developed model-free optimal control techniques for managing renewable energy sources in electric grids.  Since joining Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, I've conducted research focusing on the use of optimal control/reinforcement learning techniques for electric grid cybersecurity.  Additionally, I have applied time series analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze electric power distribution system synchrophasor data.
